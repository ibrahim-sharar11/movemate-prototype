---

## 🎬 OPENING (0:00 - 0:30) - 30 seconds

**[Show landing screen]**

> "Hi, I'm Ibrahim Sharar, and this is a demonstration of MoveMate, my interactive prototype for an on-demand movers booking platform. MoveMate is designed to transform the stressful moving experience by providing transparent pricing, easy mover comparison, and real-time tracking. Let me show you the complete user journey from booking to post-move rating."

**[Click "Get Started" button]**

---

## 📝 STEP 1: MOVE DETAILS (0:30 - 1:15) - 45 seconds

**[Show move details form]**

> "The booking process starts with Step 1, where users enter their move details. This form collects essential information: pickup and drop-off addresses, the move date, preferred time window, home type, and access details like whether there are stairs or an elevator."

**[Start filling out form]**

> "Notice the clean, intuitive form layout with helpful hints. All fields are required, and the form includes validation - you can't proceed with incomplete information. This prevents errors and guides users naturally through the process."

**[Fill in fields as you speak]**
- Pickup: "123 King St W, Toronto"
- Drop-off: "456 Queen St E, Toronto"
- Date: Select a future date
- Time: "10-12 AM"
- Home type: "1 Bedroom"
- Access: "Stairs - 1 flight"

> "The date picker prevents selecting past dates, and all dropdowns provide clear options. Users can also add special notes about parking constraints or elevator bookings."

**[Click "Continue to inventory"]**

---

## 📦 STEP 2: INVENTORY (1:15 - 1:45) - 30 seconds

**[Show inventory screen]**

> "Step 2 uses interactive counters to estimate inventory volume. Instead of typing numbers, users simply click plus or minus buttons. This is much more intuitive, prevents invalid input like negative numbers or text, and provides immediate visual feedback."

**[Demonstrate counter interactions]**

> "Watch as I click the plus button on the bedroom counter - you can see the number updates instantly with a smooth animation. The same works for living rooms, boxes, and heavy items."

**[Click + on bedroom counter, then + on boxes counter]**

> "Users can also add notes about fragile items in the text area below. This information helps movers prepare appropriately."

**[Maybe type: "Glass desk and full-length mirror"]**

> "The real-time visual feedback makes it easy to see what you're moving. Once satisfied, users proceed to see their price estimate."

**[Click "See price estimate"]**

---

## 💰 STEP 3: PRICE ESTIMATE & MOVER SELECTION (1:45 - 2:45) - 60 seconds

**[Show estimate screen]**

> "Step 3 is where MoveMate really shines. Users get an instant price estimate with a completely transparent breakdown. You can see the price range here - in this case, three hundred twenty to three hundred eighty dollars."

**[Point to price estimate]**

> "The breakdown shows exactly what you're paying for: a base fee, distance costs, and time complexity. But more importantly, the system explains why this estimate was calculated - building trust through transparency."

**[Point to breakdown and reasons]**

> "Now, users can compare multiple movers side-by-side. Each mover card shows their rating, number of jobs completed, on-time percentage, and an individual price estimate based on their pricing model."

**[Point to mover cards]**

> "Notice how each mover has different strengths - this one has the highest rating, this one offers the best price, and this one has the most experience. Users can sort by best match, lowest price, or highest rating to find what matters most to them."

**[Change sort option to show it updates]**

> "The selection is clear and visual - when I click on a mover, you can see it highlights with a border and shadow. This gives users confidence in their choice."

**[Click on a mover to select it]**

> "Once a mover is selected, users can proceed to review and confirm their booking."

**[Click "Continue with selected mover"]**

---

## ✅ BOOKING CONFIRMATION (2:45 - 3:00) - 15 seconds

**[Show confirmation screen]**

> "The booking summary shows everything clearly - all move details, the selected mover, and the final price estimate. Users can review everything before committing."

**[Scroll through summary]**

> "Notice the celebration animation when I confirm - this provides positive feedback and makes the booking feel like an accomplishment."

**[Click "Confirm booking"]**

> "Once confirmed, users move to the tracking screen where they can monitor their move in real-time."

---

## 🚚 TRACKING FEATURE (3:00 - 3:45) - 45 seconds

**[Show tracking screen]**

> "The tracking screen simulates real-time status updates during the move. A visual timeline shows progress through five distinct stages: Scheduled, Mover on the way, Arrived, In progress, and Completed."

**[Point to status timeline]**

> "Each status update animates to show progress. This addresses the anxiety users feel on moving day - they always know where things stand. The current status is shown in this pill indicator at the top."

**[Point to status pill]**

> "In a full implementation, this area would show actual GPS tracking with a live map. For the prototype, we have a placeholder that demonstrates the concept."

**[Point to map placeholder]**

> "Let me use the demo control to simulate status updates. Watch as I advance through the stages - you can see each status icon activates with an animation, and the timeline fills in progressively."

**[Click "Advance status" button 2-3 times]**

> "This real-time communication is what users expect in modern on-demand services, and it builds trust through transparency."

---

## ⭐ RATING SYSTEM (3:45 - 4:15) - 30 seconds

**[Show rating screen after completing move]**

> "After the move is complete, users can rate their mover with a 5-star system. This feedback loop helps maintain service quality and improves recommendations for future users."

**[Demonstrate rating]**

> "Users simply click on the stars - notice the hover effect and the visual feedback. They can also add optional comments about their experience."

**[Click on 4 stars, maybe type a comment]**

> "Once submitted, the rating is saved and the move is added to the user's history."

**[Click "Submit rating"]**

---

## 📋 PAST MOVES HISTORY (4:15 - 4:45) - 30 seconds

**[Show past moves screen]**

> "All completed moves are saved in the user's history. This screen shows move details, prices, movers used, and ratings given. This helps users track their moving history and builds trust in the platform."

**[Point to past moves list]**

> "The history persists across browser sessions using localStorage, so users can always refer back to their past moves."

---

## 🎯 SUMMARY & CLOSING (4:45 - 5:00) - 15 seconds

**[Show landing screen or overview]**

> "To summarize, MoveMate demonstrates several key features: transparent pricing with instant estimates and clear breakdowns, easy mover comparison with ratings and reviews, real-time tracking simulation for peace of mind, and a complete feedback system. The prototype is fully interactive, includes form validation, smooth animations, and works seamlessly on both desktop and mobile devices."
