        "\n",
        "MoveMate is an interactive prototype for an on-demand movers booking platform designed to transform the stressful moving experience into a streamlined, transparent, and user-friendly process. The prototype solves common problems in traditional moving services: lack of pricing transparency, difficulty comparing movers, uncertainty on moving day, and poor post-service feedback mechanisms.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Problem Statement:** Moving is one of life's most stressful experiences. Traditional moving services often involve hidden fees, unclear pricing, last-minute cancellations, and poor communication. Customers struggle to find reliable movers, compare options, and track their moves in real-time.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Core Value Proposition:** MoveMate provides instant price estimates with transparent breakdowns, allows users to compare trusted movers side-by-side, allows real-time tracking of their move, and lets users give feedback to maintain service quality.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Target Users:** Our primary target users are:\n",
        "- Urban residents planning local moves (apartments, condos)\n",
        "- Young professionals and students relocating within the city\n",
        "- Anyone seeking transparency, convenience, and reliability in moving services\n",
        "- Users comfortable with mobile-first, on-demand service platforms\n",
